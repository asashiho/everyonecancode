# Workshop Format: Build a To-Do Application with AI Features
This format is designed to help students walk through the sprints and user stories by following a step-by-step guide. The outline below documents the sprints and user stories that you will be implementing on your journey.   If you want to go through the entire experience, please follow them in order.  However, all user stories have fully functioning code base, so they are designed to pick up from whatever sprint / user story you want to start with.
